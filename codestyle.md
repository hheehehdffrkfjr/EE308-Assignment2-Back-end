# Code Style Guidelines


### Imports

- Group imports by standard library, third-party, and your own modules, each separated by a blank line.

### Comments

- Use comments to explain complex code, especially if it's not immediately obvious.
- Comment your functions and methods with docstrings explaining their purpose, parameters, and return values.

### Exception Handling

- Use proper exception handling to gracefully deal with errors and failures.
- Avoid using broad `except` statements; catch specific exceptions.

## Flask


### Routes

- Define routes with appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.).
- Use clear and descriptive route names and URLs.
- Ensure your routes are self-explanatory and follow RESTful conventions.

### Request Handling

- Utilize request parameters, forms, and JSON data appropriately.
- Sanitize user inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities.

### JSON Responses

- Return JSON responses consistently.
- Include meaningful HTTP status codes in your responses.

### Error Handling

- Implement proper error handling and return informative error messages.
- Log errors and exceptions for debugging.
